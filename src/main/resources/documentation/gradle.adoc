== Gradle build script

=== Wrapper

We use the wrapper to be sure that everybody builds the project with the same version of gradle. The wrapper gives us
 the place to define the version of gradle to be used on any build environment, without the need of installation of a
  version of gradle.

=== Bower plugin

The bower plugin (https://github.com/craigburke/bower-installer-gradle) is used to call bower from gradle.
Stopped using it. It deletes the bower.json file, and I want to split the project.

=== Test

Four directories are created with tests:

* test: standard java unit tests;
* integrationTest: the java integration tests;
* docs

```
bower {
    installBase = 'src/main/resources/static/components'
}
```
